## Description

My motivation for making this project was to make a full stack application that users can post and comment on anything coding related!
I did, however, find this project to be very difficult. As far as the state of the application, I need a lot more time and help with coding the back end and a lot of time to make the front end look nicer for sure!
I am proud of myself of being able to code this project on such short notice considering that my computer broke when I moved, but I do intend on coming back to the project in the future.
